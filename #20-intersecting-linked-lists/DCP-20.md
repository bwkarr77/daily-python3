Good morning!

Here's a solution to yesterday's problem.

This is your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.

For example, given A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 and B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10, return the node with value 8.

In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects.

Do this in O(M + N) time (where M and N are the lengths of the lists) and constant space.

We will be sending the solution tomorrow, along with tomorrow's question. As always, feel free to shoot us an email if there's anything we can help with.

Have a great day!
